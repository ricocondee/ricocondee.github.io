      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I currently live in Barranquilla, Colombia. Growing up, I always
        imagined myself as a doctor, wanting to make a difference in
        people&apos;s lives. However, life had other plans, and I found myself
        drawn to the world of software and technology. Even though I&apos;m not
        the most outgoing person, I&apos;m passionate about using technology to
        create solutions that improve people&apos;s lives.
