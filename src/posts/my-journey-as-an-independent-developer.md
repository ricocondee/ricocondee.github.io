**Since 2021, I have dedicated myself to software and web development.**

Driven by a passion for continuous learning, I’ve used my skills to bridge the technical gap for small businesses in need of support.

**My work is fueled by a larger purpose. I want to give back to my community and help others succeed.** This year has been especially transformative; using AI as a powerful partner has allowed me to speed up projects and deliver even better results.
